5,Call_of_Duty,10/18/2023,"Edit: the Developers responded to my review directly and not in a generic way, so huge respect for that. I've decided that because of willingness to take specific criticisms I have to change my review to a recommend. It means the game will only get better and that they WANT to make the game better from user feedback. It means they actually care and that goes a loooooong way for me",helpful,Recommended,4.8

20,Call_of_Duty,10/14/2023,"What I would like to see if you make new games/ DLC is more variation in traits on characters for more variation in maxed characters, a little bit smoother/ quicker UI in battle maps. A little more customization for the main character's class would be a nice touch.

39,Call_of_Duty,10/17/2023,"The game is very good. I am however extremely dissapointed with the co-op. They said multiple times leading up to the release that you can play the whole game with a friend. You can *technically* do that, but onle the host gets story and boss progress, special items, spells, and the biggest sinner of all, boss loot/rememberence. The coop was the biggest reason me and my friend was excited about the game, because we love souls like games, but hate the way From Software designs their coop. If you're only getting this to play with a friend, don't. If you're getting this to play a really good souls like by yourself, absolutely get it",helpful,Recommended,24.6
40,Call_of_Duty,10/12/2023,"Somewhat of a rocky start but overall, it's not been horrible. There was some issues getting the game to launch but after figuring that black screen problem out, it's all been smooth. The graphics are great and the ambient sounds honestly do a great job of making it feel like you're sitting in the lower decks of a ship sometimes. A lot could be added to the game, and although I'm sure the devs will be continuing to work on things, the fact that modding is supported is huge for the longevity of the game. Overall, there is a lot of potential for this to take off. I'd say it's already worth the $30 and it certainly will keep it's value moving forward.",helpful,Recommended,21.1

NEGATIVE NOTE: it's a short-term pastime, there are no achievements, cards or items in the shop. Nothing. Really exaggerated price for the contents it has, it has practically none, they are funny stories and that's all.

The air pressure system needs a patch, but the moon and the other space stuff seems to work well. They changed the rocket engines, so they have to be replaced on every creation that uses them like missiles for example. They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all. The Stormworks devs have been working on this DLC for years, so they didn't do it for purely the money, but I would still wait a month or two before getting this DLC.",helpful,Recommended,

The graphics are great and the ambient sounds honestly do a great job of making it feel like you're sitting in the lower decks of a ship sometimes. A lot could be added to the game, and although I'm sure the devs will be continuing to work on things, the fact that modding is supported is huge for the longevity of the game. Overall, there is a lot of potential for this to take off. I'd say it's already worth the $30 and it certainly will keep it's value moving forward.",helpful,Recommended,21.1

They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all.

The coop was the biggest reason me and my friend was excited about the game, because we love souls like games, but hate the way From Software designs their coop.

Really exaggerated price for the contents it has, it has practically none, they are funny stories and that's all. It's a game that should be bought at a super discount because in the price range at which it is sold, you will certainly find better. my rating 6/10",helpful,Recommended,0.2

They changed the rocket engines, so they have to be replaced on every creation that uses them like missiles for example. They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all. The Stormworks devs have been working on this DLC for years, so they didn't do it for purely the money, but I would still wait a month or two before getting this DLC.",helpful,Recommended,

They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all.

39,Call_of_Duty_Ghosts,10/17/2023,"The game is very good. I am however extremely dissapointed with the co-op. They said multiple times leading up to the release that you can play the whole game with a friend. You can *technically* do that, but onle the host gets story and boss progress, special items, spells, and the biggest sinner of all, boss loot/rememberence. The coop was the biggest reason me and my friend was excited about the game, because we love souls like games, but hate the way From Software designs their coop.

The graphics are great and the ambient sounds honestly do a great job of making it feel like you're sitting in the lower decks of a ship sometimes. A lot could be added to the game, and although I'm sure the devs will be continuing to work on things, the fact that modding is supported is huge for the longevity of the game.

The air pressure system needs a patch, but the moon and the other space stuff seems to work well. They changed the rocket engines, so they have to be replaced on every creation that uses them like missiles for example. They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all. The Stormworks devs have been working on this DLC for years, so they didn't do it for purely the money, but I would still wait a month or two before getting this DLC.",helpful,Recommended,

The coop was the biggest reason me and my friend was excited about the game, because we love souls like games, but hate the way From Software designs their coop.

They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all.

They said multiple times leading up to the release that you can play the whole game with a friend. You can *technically* do that, but onle the host gets story and boss progress, special items, spells, and the biggest sinner of all, boss loot/rememberence. The coop was the biggest reason me and my friend was excited about the game, because we love souls like games, but hate the way From Software designs their coop.

The graphics are great and the ambient sounds honestly do a great job of making it feel like you're sitting in the lower decks of a ship sometimes. A lot could be added to the game, and although I'm sure the devs will be continuing to work on things, the fact that modding is supported is huge for the longevity of the game.

They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all. The Stormworks devs have been working on this DLC for years, so they didn't do it for purely the money, but I would still wait a month or two before getting this DLC.",helpful,Recommended,

The coop was the biggest reason me and my friend was excited about the game, because we love souls like games, but hate the way From Software designs their coop.

They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all.

They changed the rocket engines, so they have to be replaced on every creation that uses them like missiles for example. They also fixed the pivot glitch, a very common way people made boats/submarines float in Stormworks is by putting pivots on the bottom of them, now that doesn't work so most water vehicles don't float as well if at all.
